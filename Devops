### üîÑ DevOps & Automation (Fully Expanded)

DevOps integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality.

### üîÅ CI/CD in Cloud (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)

#### What is CI/CD?
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automatically building and testing code whenever a developer pushes changes.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):** Automating the release process to production.

#### Key Phases:
1. **Source** ‚Äì Code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
2. **Build** ‚Äì Compile code, run linters (e.g., AWS CodeBuild, Azure Pipelines)
3. **Test** ‚Äì Unit/integration testing (e.g., Selenium, JUnit)
4. **Deploy** ‚Äì Push to test/prod environments (e.g., CodeDeploy, Azure Release Pipelines)

#### Tools:
- **AWS:** CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline
- **Azure:** Azure Repos, Pipelines, Release
- **Others:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI

### üìú Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### What is IaC?
IaC is managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware or manual configuration.

#### Benefits:
- Version control
- Repeatability
- Reduced configuration drift
- Faster provisioning

#### Tools:
- **AWS CloudFormation:** JSON/YAML templates to define AWS infrastructure
- **Terraform:** Open-source tool supporting multiple cloud providers; uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM):** Templates for Azure resources
- **Pulumi:** Code-based IaC using languages like TypeScript, Python

#### Concepts to Master:
- Modules
- State files (for Terraform)
- Change sets (for CloudFormation)
- Dependency graphs

### üê≥ Containers & Orchestration

#### What is a Container?
A lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings.

#### Why Containers?
- Portability across environments
- Lightweight and faster than VMs
- Consistent behavior from dev to prod

#### Docker:
- The most popular container platform
- Use Dockerfile to define image
- Commands: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker push`, `docker-compose`

#### Kubernetes (K8s):
- Open-source orchestration platform for managing containerized workloads
- Handles scaling, deployment, load balancing
- Core objects: Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets

#### AWS & Azure Integrations:
- **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service):** Container orchestration by AWS
- **AWS Fargate:** Serverless compute for containers
- **Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service):** Managed Kubernetes on Azure

### üß™ DevOps Best Practices
- Version control everything (code + infrastructure)
- Automate as much as possible (CI/CD, testing, security scans)
- Shift-left testing and security (test early)
- Use feature flags for safer deployments
- Monitor everything (logging + metrics)
- Blue/Green and Canary deployments for safe rollouts
